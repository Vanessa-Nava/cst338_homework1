              <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
              <p>Artificial Intelligence, better known as AI, is the intelligence displayed by machines.</p>
              <p>Without human knowlege AI would not be possible because it is the humans who write the </p>
              <p>code to propt the computer how to think or react.</p>        
              <p>Many people have their opinion about AI innovations; some believe the concept is a good thing</p>
              <p>while others think there is much risk on the ideas.</p>
